# IoTry_2

Original Repo fix for IoTry 1 but that was resolved. Now just a pre-emptive repo for an actual IoTry 2, using one of my real STM32 dev kits, which have an actual Standard Peripheral Library instead of resorting to HAL, as well as ESP32 for WIFI (and communicating between devices). 

Will be a more complicated but more controlled version of IoTry, with external sensors (TBD) reading through I2C and maybe SPI. 

Additional information to be determined when IoTry 1 finished.
